## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, please do not hesitate to contact us by [mail](mailto:auto-record@labaj.com.pl?subject=Security Vulnerability) or open a [draft security advisory](https://github.com/pawellabaj/auto-record/security/advisories/new).

We take all security reports seriously and will do our best to address the issue promptly.

## Scanning Tools

We use the following scanning tools in our project to help identify and prevent security vulnerabilities:

- [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot)
- [SonarCloud](https://www.sonarsource.com/solutions/security/)
- [Sonatype Lift](https://lift.sonatype.com/)

These tools are used as part of our regular development and release process to help maintain the security and integrity of our project.
